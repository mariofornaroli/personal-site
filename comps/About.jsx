                    A <span className="color-theme">Software Engineer</span> graduated

                  <p>
                    I have a strong background in Information Technology as I carried out various IT projects during my professional experience.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    During my work experience I have developed various web applications, mainly working with the following technologies: Reactjs (both with React only and with Redux+Saga, now moving to React Hooks + Context API), Angular 2+ and AngularJS, plus obviously Jquery-html5-css3-js, (frontend side) and .Net technologies, such as Web API/Asp MVC - Entity Framework, Node.js + Express â€“ Microsoft Sql server and MongoDB (backend side).
                  </p>
                  <p>I have worked also on mobile development projects, targeting Android platform mainly. Coming from a web-developer background it was a natural choice to select multi-platform technology web based as Cordova, with the support of Ionic Framework (using several plugins to reach native functionalities).</p>

                  <p>In my first years I also developed Windows applications (mainly C# .Net with WPF), multi-platform applications (C++ Qt framework for Linux), often in the domain of cryptography and security, and I DLLs (C/C++ language) to communicate with external devices through API.</p>
                  <p>I enjoy a lot working with Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio, depending on the project! They are my favorite IDE. I also developed some project with Qt Creator and Borland/Embarcadero.</p>

                  <p>I am passionate about my job!</p>
                  <p>I constantly train myself, mainly through online courses the evening after the work.</p>
